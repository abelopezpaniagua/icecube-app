# 🧠 Smart Task Collaboration Platform – Frontend

This is the frontend client for the **Smart Task Collaboration Platform** – a modern web-based tool that enables users to create and manage workspaces, boards, and tasks collaboratively, with support for real-time interactions, notifications, and AI task suggestions.

This project follows the **SOFEA architecture**, where the frontend is fully decoupled from the backend API.
